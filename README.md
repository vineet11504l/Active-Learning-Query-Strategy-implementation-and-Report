# Active Learning Query Strategies Implementation and a Report

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a soybean crop dataset with multiple features, providing insights into the factors influencing yield. The EDA phase included statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover relationships between features and their impact on crop yield.

In addition to EDA, various active learning strategies were implemented and rigorously compared. These strategies include:

- **Egalitarian (EGAL)**
- **Expected Model Change Maximization (EMCM)**
- **Greedy Sampling**
- **Random Sampling**
- **Query by Committee**
- **Decision Tree-Based Strategy**

Each technique was evaluated for its effectiveness in reducing labeling costs while maintaining model accuracy, making them highly relevant for datasets with limited labeled samples.

A detailed report was also prepared to document active learning query strategies and benchmark datasets across three significant tasks:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
2. **Anomaly Detection**
3. **Tabular Classification**

This report serves as a valuable resource for understanding how active learning can be tailored to different data modalities and problem domains.

This project effectively integrates EDA and active learning to provide actionable insights and a framework for applying these methods in real-world scenarios. The combination of robust data analysis and innovative sampling techniques makes this work a useful reference for researchers and practitioners alike, encouraging further exploration and adaptation in diverse fields.
